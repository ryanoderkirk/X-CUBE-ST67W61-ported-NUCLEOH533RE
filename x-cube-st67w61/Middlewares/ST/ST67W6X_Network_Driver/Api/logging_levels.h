  * Each part using the logging should specify a log level by setting LOG_LEVEL.
  * If a LOG_LEVEL is not defined locally by the part, then it is used the global LOG_LEVEL.
  * All log messages with a level at or below the specified level will be printed
  * for that part.
  * Currently, there are 4 log levels. In the order of lowest to highest, they are:
  * - #LOG_NONE <br>
  *   @copybrief LOG_NONE

  *         for debugging and may contain excessive information such as internal
  *         variables, buffers, or other specific information.
